# **HTML5-Canvas-Bubbles-App**
This repository contains the code for the Bubbles App, a simple game built using plain JavaScript and HTML5 without any third-party libraries. The game is divided into two modules, each adding specific functionality to enhance the interactive experience.

**Assignment Overview**
This assignment aims to create a game that allows users to interact with graphical elements on an HTML5 canvas. The game involves the following modules:

**Module 1: Circle and Arrow Drawing**

Draw a circle filled with a random color on the left side of the canvas.
Draw an arrow on the right side of the same canvas element.
Both elements must be rendered using only JavaScript and HTML5.

**Module 2: Interactivity with Buttons**

Add a **"Hit"** button:
When pressed, the arrow moves towards the circle.
Upon impact, the circle’s color changes to a new random color.
Add a **"Reset"** button:
Resets the game to its initial state, allowing the user to play again.

**Note:-**
Verify that the circle and arrow are rendered correctly in Module 1.
Test the interactivity of the "Hit" and "Reset" buttons in Module 2.
Ensure that the circle’s color changes upon impact and that the game resets properly.
