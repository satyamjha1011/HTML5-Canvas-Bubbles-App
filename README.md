# **HTML5-Canvas-Bubbles-App**
This repository contains the code for the Bubbles App, a simple game built using plain JavaScript and HTML5 without any third-party libraries. The game is divided into two modules, each adding specific functionality to enhance the interactive experience.

**Assignment Overview**
This assignment aims to create a game that allows users to interact with graphical elements on an HTML5 canvas. The game involves the following modules:

**Module 1: Circle and Arrow Drawing**

Draw a circle filled with a random color on the left side of the canvas.
Draw an arrow on the right side of the same canvas element.
Both elements must be rendered using only JavaScript and HTML5.

**Module 2: Interactivity with Buttons**

Add a **"Hit"** button:
When pressed, the arrow moves towards the circle.
Upon impact, the circle’s color changes to a new random color.
Add a **"Reset"** button:
Resets the game to its initial state, allowing the user to play again.

**Note:-**
Verify that the circle and arrow are rendered correctly in Module 1.
Test the interactivity of the "Hit" and "Reset" buttons in Module 2.
Ensure that the circle’s color changes upon impact and that the game resets properly.

**BUBBLE_APP_QUESTION.pdf:**

This document provides the assignment instructions for the manual testing of the Bubbles App. It outlines the requirements for creating a game using only plain JavaScript and HTML5 without third-party libraries.
The assignment is divided into two modules:
Module 1: Involves drawing a circle filled with a random color on the left side of the canvas and an arrow on the right, both within the same canvas element.
Module 2: Adds interactivity with a "Hit" button that moves the arrow towards the circle, changing the circle’s color upon impact, and a "Reset" button to restart the game.

**BUBBLE_APP_SOLUTION.pdf:**

This document contains the source code for a game where an arrow shoots towards a circle when a "Hit" button is clicked. The circle changes its color when hit by the arrow. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code are written without using any external libraries, complying with the requirement for a plain JavaScript application.
The application features a canvas where a circle is displayed on the left and an arrow is positioned on the right. The arrow moves towards the circle when triggered by the "Hit" button, and a "Reset" button allows the user to reset the game.

The uploaded documents describe a simple JavaScript-based game called "Bubbles App":
**Game Overview:** A circle is displayed on the left side of a canvas, filled with a random color, and an arrow is positioned on the right. When the "Hit" button is clicked, the arrow moves towards the circle. Upon hitting the circle, the circle changes its color. A "Reset" button restores the game to its initial state with a new random circle color and resets the arrow position.
**Implementation:** The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries. The HTML sets up the canvas and buttons, CSS styles them, and JavaScript handles the game logic, including drawing shapes, animating the arrow, and changing colors.
